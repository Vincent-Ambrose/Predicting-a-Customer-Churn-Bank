Description of the project:

This project aims to predict if a customer will leave the bank soon. We have the data of the past behavior of 
customers and the termination of contracts with the bank.

The project is done in VS code with Jupyter Notebook extension.

In this repository you can find the .csv file to perform this analysis.
